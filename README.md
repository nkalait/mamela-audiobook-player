# Mamela Audiobook Player
![example image](https://github.com/nkalait/mamela-audiobook-player/blob/main/image.jpg?raw=true)

The aim is to build, using **Go**, an audio book player that works just right on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Mamela is a GUI application built with **fyne** (https://fyne.io) for the GUI and **BASS** (https://www.un4seen.com)  for playing audio. For those interested to know, **"mamela"** is a [Sesotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotho_language) word for **"listen"**

***Any and all assistance is welcome :)*** 

# Note
The code uses BASS(https://www.un4seen.com) somewhere under the hood so please go read on their website about licencing
