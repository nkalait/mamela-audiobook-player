!! have a channel to listen for ui shown before showing any merror.showerror(); buffered channel
!! fatal error in getChapterLengthInSeconds(); when bass cannot read a file.... I think

- have another db that stores the progress of books, ie position or finished, even after the user changes the root folder
- Access storage using getter functions
- Highlight currently playing book
- test code coverage
- FINISH UP WORKING WITH DARK AND LIGHT THEMES
- for files with chapter information embedded in them, allow skipping to next/previous chapter (will use ffmpeg for now)
- have a stop, shutdown timer
